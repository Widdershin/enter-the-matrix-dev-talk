-> # What are we going to talk about?
===========

  - IDEs vs Text Editors.
  - Why live in the terminal?
  - My development setup, specifically:
    - vim
    - tmux
    - zsh
  - How they all fit together.

------------------------------------

-> IDEs vs Text Editors
===========

 * Which is better?
 * Neither!
 * Well, a text editor, but hang on.

------------------------------------

-> Why live in the terminal?
===========

 * Unix Philosophy.
   * Composability.
   * Small tools that do one thing well.
 * Flexibility.
 * Non technical people think you're a wizard.

------------------------------------

-> vim
============

 * A modal text editor.
 * Lightweight (unless you use as many plugins as I do).
 * Fun, concise commands.
 * Plugins!!!

-> This slide can be replaced with terminal based $EDITOR of your choice.

------------------------------------

-> tmux
============

 * Like a window manager for your terminals.
 * tmux is a server, you connect to it.
 * Your terminal will still be there if you close the window.
 * You can run it on a server and work from anywhere.
 * Sessions/windows/splits.
 * Plugins!!!

------------------------------------

-> zsh
============

 * Like bash, but more fun.
 * Syntax highlighting for commands.
 * Tab completion everywhere.
 * Plugins!!!
 * Excellent for annoying Roger.

-> This slide can be replaced with the terminal of your choice.

------------------------------------

-> Putting it all together
============

 * Demo time!

------------------------------------

-> Recap
============

  * You can do all of your development work in the terminal.
  * It's surprisingly awesome.
  * It's the most flexible development env I've used.
